## ASSUMPTIONS MADE
- The transactions for users could still be taken further based on business or product decisions
- Tests were written for some of the methods
- OOP was used to model service classes
- As at the time of implementation, Stripe did not allow opening an account from Africa so there was no way to test the implementation.
